<h1>Reflection</h1>

<h2>Positives</h2>
<p>I can see where there are benefits to using these types of programs. I know I enjoyed using markdown language and utilizing Stackedit the most. It was easier for me to use and understand. However, I can see where using HTML language would be more beneficial. In some cases, you paint a clearer picture, and is easier to transfer between different sites. I never thought I would be able to publish my own website, and yet, I did. I know I’m not the techiest person in my family so learning all of this was a fun challenge. I greatly appreciate how easy you made it to understand and follow along while also leaving room for us to struggle and explore.</p>

<h2>Negatives</h2>
<p>Pictures and I just don’t get along. Every step of the way I struggled with uploading pictures. Sometimes I would figure out where I went wrong. Other times, I have zero idea how I was finally able to upload my images. I think what inhibited me the most was thinking I was doing something wrong or I just couldn’t understand enough to solve the problem. This is my first time doing any of this, so when I struggled with something, I always thought I was doing something wrong. In many cases, it was only because of how I was wording something or not uploading the correct file.</p>
<p>My other little thing was having to use W3 cite. For some reason, what took me the longest was trying to figure out how to download the project. The site wouldn’t allow me to just download one file and I needed to upgrade to download the zip and I was ready to punch something. Thankfully I finally figured it out, but I definitely took a break afterward. But that is just a personal struggle, nothing to do with learning about HTML and markdown/up language.</p>
