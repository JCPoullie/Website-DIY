<h1>Importance of Publishing</h1>
<blockquote><i><strong>"Nothing stink like a pile of unpublished writing"</strong> ~Sylvia Plath</i></blockquote>

<h2>How Publishing has Impacted Me</h2>
<p>The closest thing I have to publishing is entering projects into the <a href="https://www.ozaukeecountyfair.com">Ozaukee County Fair</a>, and that is a big part of me. It allows me to share what I see with others. It's always entertaining seeing people pausing to look at my work, sometimes praising how beautiful the photos look. It's even more rewarding when family and friends see my work and compliment on how well I did.</p>

<h2>What I Wish to do with Publishing</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Share more photos</li>
  <li>Share my words and stories</li>
  <li>Form <strong>connections</strong>
</ul>
I love writing and I would love to have people read my stories. The smile it can bring to peopleâ€™s faces or the emotions it lets them feel. I want to have the ability to form connections with people the way current authors and artists are able to form connections withe me. <br>Because of digital publishing, I have greater choices. I can still have physical copies, but I can also share my work digitally for even more people to see.
